# a-good-villain-or-general
With this application you can get some inspiration for being a good villain or general based on [the Evil Overlord List](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=evil+overlord+list) and The Art of War by Sun Tzu respectively. This happens in the form of two quizzes, one for each topic. When starting a quiz, the application will randomly select a series of multiple choices questions on the topic with each having three options. Only one of the options is correct. After the quiz, your average amount of correct answers displayed in the main page is updated, allowing you to improve your performance.

In the application you can log in and out or register as a user and keep track of your average amount of correct answers.

The app can be tested at Heroku [here](https://vogjat.herokuapp.com/start).
